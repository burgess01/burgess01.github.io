### Task

I wanted to create a simulation of the basic terminal commands in MacOS/Linux systems

### Solution

I created both a standard input and command line version in order to increase realism. I also used only basic imports in order to make this more realistic to how it would be implemented on an operating system level if it was to be realistically implemented in Python.
