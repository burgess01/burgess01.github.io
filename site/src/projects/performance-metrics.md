### Task

I wanted to practice basic testing and benchmarking in several languages, those being Go, C and Python.

### Solution

The solution was the code in the github repository linked below. I run two files in each language, one that tests for prime numbers and one that selects the smaller out of two values. I then write tests and benchmarks in all three languages in order to test the efficiency and accuracy of these programs.
