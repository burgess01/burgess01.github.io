### Task

In order to have an easier time grading repository-based work, the Allegheny Computer Science department wanted to design a grading software that could take in custom grading checks. These grading checks can be run both locally and on Github Actions.

### Solution

The solution to this was gatorgrade. This is a package published to Github Marketplace so that anyone is able to use it for their repositories in order to ensure proper function. The checks that are run are stored in a specially-formatted .yml file.
